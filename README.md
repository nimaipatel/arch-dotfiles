# My dotfiles and setup instructions for \*NIX systems

I've tried to put everything I can into `~/.config`

## On new computer, as non-root user, run:

```
curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nimaipatel/dotfiles/master/install.sh' | sh -x
```

While pulling there might be conflicts with existing files on the computer. In
this case, delete the original files.
